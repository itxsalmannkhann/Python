# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey (Line-by-Line Progress)

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to documenting my entire experience of learning the Python programming language.

## 🎯 Repository Goal

The primary goal of this repository is accountability and tracking. I am committing to posting **every single line of code** I write during my learning process. This includes:

* Daily code-along exercises.
* Solutions to programming challenges.
* Small, standalone scripts for testing concepts.
* Notes on new functions and modules.

Every commit represents a step forward, no matter how small!

## 📘 Learning Resources & Curriculum

I am currently focusing on the following areas:

* **Fundamentals:** Data Types, Variables, Operators
* **Control Flow:** `if/else`, `for` loops, `while` loops
* **Data Structures:** Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
* **Functions:** Defining, Arguments, Scope (`global`/`local`)
* **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** Classes, Inheritance (future focus)
* **File Handling:** Reading and writing files (future focus)

*(Feel free to update this section with the specific course or book you are using!)*

## 📂 Repository Structure

You will find the code organized by concept:

| Directory | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01_basics/` | Variables, print statements, basic math |
| `02_control_flow/` | `if/elif/else` and simple loops |
| `03_data_structures/` | List methods, dictionary manipulation |
| `99_sandbox/` | Quick tests and throwaway scripts |

## 🚀 Future Goals

Once I have a solid grasp of the basics, I plan to move on to:

1.  Creating a small **command-line utility** (e.g., a simple to-do list).
2.  Working with external **libraries** (e.g., `requests` for web data).
3.  Deploying a very basic **web application** using Flask or Django.

Happy coding! Let the journey begin!
